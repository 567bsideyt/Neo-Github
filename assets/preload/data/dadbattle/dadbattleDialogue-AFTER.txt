:bf:...and you're suprised, how?

:dad:Shut up! Hmm... There's this concert happening in a few hours and it just so happens that there is an available spot for you to go against the spookeez at the Raveyard.

:dad:If you rush there you might just make it in time...

:bf:Gotcha, we'll head over there now!
